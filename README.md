## Flash Continuation
To play Empires & Allies you'll need the *Adobe Flash Player* and a *browser with Flash support*:

:flashlight: **Adobe Flash Player**
> 
>
> [Download Flash Player](https://archive.org/download/flashplayerarchive/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_32.0.0.371_archive.zip/32_0_r0_371%2Fflashplayer32_0r0_371_win.exe) for **Firefox** and **Basilisk** – NPAPI
> 
> [Download Flash Player](https://archive.org/download/flashplayerarchive/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_32.0.0.371_archive.zip/32_0_r0_371%2Fflashplayer32_0r0_371_winpep.exe) for Opera and **Chromium** based applications – PPAPI
>
> *Note:* All downloads are for Flash Player [32.0.0.371](https://archive.org/download/flashplayerarchive/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/fp_32.0.0.371_archive.zip/), the last version without [End-of-Life](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) kill switch, from the Adobe Inc. [Flash Player Archive](https://archive.org/download/flashplayerarchive/).

:mag: **Browsers with Flash support**

> [Firefox 84.0 64-bit](https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/84.0/win64/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2084.0.exe) or [32-bit](https://download-installer.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/84.0/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2084.0.exe) (14 Dec 2020), the final version to support Flash.
> 
> **Important:** By default, Firefox is set for automatic updates. To prevent Firefox from automatically updating itself after you install an older version, you'll need to change your Firefox update settings: Click the menu button (三) and select *Options*. In the *General* panel, go to the *Firefox Updates* section.
> 
> [Chromium 82.0](https://chromium.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/2181158), the open-source projects behind the Google Chrome browser.
> 
> [Basilisk Browser](https://www.basilisk-browser.org/), which fully supports all NPAPI plugins (i.e. Flash). It's a fork of the Mozilla/Firefox code.
